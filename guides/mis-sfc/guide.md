# 🏭 **MiS \* SFC Drills Guide**

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn how to **join rallies correctly** (right leader heroes & troop ratios) — both **attacking and defending**.
- Practice **self-control** ❌
  → Do **NOT** join rallies you're not assigned to
  _(Example: FC4 joining FC5-only rallies)_.
- **Swap garrison hero & ratios** after successfully taking control of the Castle.

---

## 👑 Rally Leaders

1. ⭐ **Main Rally Leader \* #STAR**

   - **FC5 ONLY** may join

2. 🦘 **Secondary Rally Leaders \* Kangaroo & Spaikius**

   - **FC4 & FC5** may join

> ⚠️ **FC = Troops, NOT Furnace**

---

## 🗺️ Drill Setup

- **Zantas** will be on **MiZ side**
- **MiS** will be **attacking the Castle**
- All **3 rally leaders** will create rallies

  - ⭐ #STAR will launch **slightly delayed** to ensure it **lands last**

---

## ⚔️ Rally Joining Rules (ATTACK PHASE)

### ✅ Who Can Join

- **FC4 & FC5**

### 🪖 Required Setup

- **Troop Ratio:** 30 / 20 / 50
  _(Infantry / Lancer / Marksman)_
- **Leader Hero:** **Jessie**

⏱️ Joiners will be **actively monitored**

---

## 🏰 After #STAR Takes Castle (DEFENSE PHASE)

### 🔄 EVERYONE who joined ⭐ #STAR must switch to:

- **Troop Ratio:** `60 / 40 / 0`
- **Leader Hero:** **Patric**

---

## 🛠️ How to Swap Correctly (VERY IMPORTANT)

1. 🚚 Dispatch **new reinforcements** to the Castle:

   - **60 / 40 / 0**
   - **Patric** as leader

2. ⏳ Wait until the new reinforcements are **~5 seconds away**
3. 🔁 **Relief / Cancel** your current troops in the Castle
   → New troops will **replace them instantly**

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Enemy Rally Defense

- **MiZ WILL create rallies**
- Everyone inside the Castle must:

  - 👀 **Monitor enemy rally timers**
  - ⏱️ **Time reinforcements to arrive ~1 second AFTER enemy rally hits**

### ❓ Why?

- **Lightly Injured Troops DO NOT defend**
- They only **take space**
- To replace them, **constantly send 60 / 40 reinforcements**
