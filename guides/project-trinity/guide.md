# ❄️ Joint Alliance Project ❄️

## 🏰 What is this project?

We're creating **one joint alliance** where everyone can gather to participate in **Sunfire Castle Battles during SvS**.

- Initial name: **Project: Trinity**
- Current alliance name: **MiZ**
- (Renaming planned later 👀)

---

## 👥 Who can join?

Members from:

- **MiS**
- **ROK**
- **HXH**
- **WLF**

Everyone is welcome to participate 💪

---

## 🤔 Why do we need this?

Creating one strong alliance helps us:

- 📣 Simplify **rally calling, canceling, filling, and coordination**
- ❤️ Improve **tap healing**
- 🎯 Enable **centralized commanding**
- 🚫 Avoid hitting each other's rallies
- 👀 No more multiple people calling incoming rallies across different alliances
- ⚙️ Reduce unnecessary moving parts that previously slowed us down

Overall, this removes a lot of friction and makes us **much more efficient**.

---

## ⚔️ Strategy & Goals

- **Zantas is fully maxed**, and we've seen it only takes **2 Paros-level rallies** to take him down
- 🎯 **Final goal**: Take down enemy captains with **only two rallies**
- Not today—but **soon**. Step by step, we'll get there 💪

### 🧠 Tactical improvement

- We will use **staggered rallies**
- For now, we'll call **2-3 rallies**
- Previously, we sent all rallies at once, making us vulnerable to counter-rallies

Also, realistically:

- 🐋 Most states have **one big whale**
- The rest are semi-whales, but not overwhelmingly strong

This works in our favor.

---

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

Upcoming **state-level events** will benefit massively from one strong alliance:

- 🐉 Frostdragon Tyrant
- 🏹 Tundra Arms League

Building a unified alliance now will make us **much stronger** for these events.
