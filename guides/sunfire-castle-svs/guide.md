# 🔥 **SVS - Sunfire Castle Battle Strategy**

---

### ⚙️ **Preparation Phase**

🐉 **Combat buffs and pets** work - always use them for an edge!
💪 Especially the **Troop Deployment Capacity buff** - the fewer people we need to fill a rally, the more can focus on other objectives.

### ⚔️ **Phase 1 - Opening Minutes**

#### 🛡️ **Defensive Rallies**

- Main hero: **Patrick** - his defense skills are key when holding.
- Recommended formations:
  - **60 / 40 / 0** → Infantry / Lancer / Marksman (balanced defense)
  - **80 / 20 / 0** → When facing strong rally pushes - prioritize survivability.

#### 💥 **Offensive Rallies**

- Main hero: **Jessie** - her **R5 skill** grants **+25% attack boost**, essential for damage rallies.
- Recommended formation:
  - **30 / 20 / 50** → Infantry / Lancer / Marksman

### 🧭 **Early Battle Plan**

1️⃣ **HxH & RoK:**

- Immediately **create all available rallies** as soon as the battle begins.

2️⃣ **Zantas:**

- Attempts to **solo capture the Sunfire Castle** right from the start.

3️⃣ **MiS Members (supporting Zantas):**

- Send **solo attacks** using **defensive formations (60/40/0)**
- Lead with a **defensive hero** to help hold the castle after capture.

## 🍎 **SVS - Trigger Call & Rally Coordination Protocol** 🍏

---

### 🚨 **Trigger Signal**

Once the **enemy’s strongest rally** is formed, Command will issue the **Trigger Call** in rally chat:

> 🍎🍏🍎🍏

This is the signal for **RoK** and **HxH** to **initiate their counter rallies**.
**Rally Order:** ➡️ **HxH → RoK → Zantas**

### ⚔️ **Rally Timing & Coordination**

- ⏱️ **Timing is critical** - rallies should land within **10 seconds** of each other.
- 💬 **Do not delay or overthink** - once the call is made, act fast.
- 🧭 Both **RoK** and **HxH** must coordinate rally order:
  → **Strongest rallies launch last** for maximum impact.
- 🗣️ After creating rallies, rally leads must **immediately notify the team in chat**.

### 🏰 **Castle Control Outcomes**

#### ✅ **If Zantas Successfully Defends Sunfire Castle**

➡️ **HxH** and **RoK** must **cancel their rallies immediately** - conserve troops and reinforce Zantas’ hold.

#### ❌ **If Zantas is Kicked Out**

➡️ After **RoK** and **HxH recapture** the castle,
**Zantas** will **reclaim control** by sending his own rally next.

> 🏆 This ensures **Zantas remains the final holder** of Sunfire Castle,
> while **HxH** and **RoK** serve as **counter-rally and support teams**.

## 🏰 **Phase 3 - Taking Back the Castle**

When the **enemy captures Sunfire Castle**, switch into **Reclaim Mode**.

---

### ⚔️ **Rally Order & Execution**

**🎯 Rally Chain:** ➡️ **HxH → RoK → Zantas**

1️⃣ **HxH** creates rallies first.
2️⃣ **RoK** follows immediately after HxH launches.
3️⃣ **Zantas** launches last, ensuring his **final strike lands after both**.

> ⏱️ Maintain **under 10-second gaps** between rallies for maximum synchronized impact.

## 📜 **Tips & Important Reminders**

⚠️ **Troop Mechanics Reminder:**
In Sunfire Castle battles, **lightly injured troops remain inside** but **no longer contribute to defense power**.
This means your **active defensive strength drops over time** as more troops become lightly injured.

💥 All **MiS members** inside the castle must **continuously send fresh reinforcements** to replace lightly injured troops and **maintain maximum defensive strength**.
