## ⚡ **TL;DR (Quick Summary)**

- 🎯 **Top Priorities:**
  1️⃣ **Prototype I & II** - _Together produce 2,400 AP/min_ (equal to **4 Repair Sites!**)
  2️⃣ **Imperial Foundry** - _1,800 AP/min when active_
  👉 **Holding both Prototypes + Imperial = 4,200 AP/min total!**

- 🔒 **Always secure and defend Prototypes first**, then other buildings.
- 🛠️ Repairs and Transit Stations add steady points and strategic flexibility.
- 🤝 Reinforce allies, protect high-value sites, and **watch for scattered points** (yellow dots).
- 🚫 This is the only event where you should use your Healing Speedups, since "tap healing" isn't available during Foundry!
- 🐉 **Combat buffs and pets** work - use them for an edge
- 🕒 You can **leave up to 12 min** and re-enter with **healed troops**.

## ⚔️ **Quick Strategy Summary**

🧪 **1️⃣ Secure and Defend Both Prototype Buildings (Top Priority!)**

- These two alone generate **2,400 AP/min**, equal to **four Repair Facilities** combined.
- Keep them reinforced at all times - **losing them costs massive points**.
- These are your **core control points** for early dominance.

🛠️ **2️⃣ Capture and Hold at Least One Repair Building**

- Adds a steady **+600 AP/min** to your total.
- Combined with both Prototypes, you'll have a **huge AP/min lead** over the enemy in the first phase.

🏛️ **3️⃣ Once the Imperial Foundry Opens (after 15 min)**

- **Drop control of a Repair building** if needed and **secure the Imperial Foundry** immediately.
- Holding **Imperial + both Prototypes** yields **4,200 AP/min** - an unmatched point advantage.
- Reinforce these three structures with your **strongest members** to lock in victory.

🎯 **4️⃣ Bait and Strike (Scattered Points Tactic)**

- Let the enemy **collect points** in certain buildings.
- When they've accumulated enough, **swoop in and clear them out!**
- Flipping a building releases **huge scattered point piles** - **gather them fast** (watch for **yellow dots** on the minimap).
- This tactic can **swing the score dramatically** in your favor.

## ⏱️ **Critical Timing: First Control Points**

> 🕐 _Imperial Foundry, Munitions Warehouse, and Mercenary Camp_
> ⏳ **Cannot be controlled until after the first 15 minutes.**

At ~15 min:

- Strongest players **transfer** their garrisons (Prototypes, Boiler, Transit) to others.
- Then **teleport mid** to secure **Imperial Foundry**.

## 🎯 **First Control Point Priorities**

1. 🧪 **Prototype** - 1200 AP/min
2. 🚉 **Central Transit Station** - 50% Teleport, but only 240 AP/min
3. 🔥 **Boiler Room** - Faster Control Time, but only 240 AP/min
4. 🛠️ **Repair Facilities** - 600 AP/min

## 🛡️ **Defense & Reinforcement Strategy**

- **Garrison** **Prototype buildings** with **your strongest troops and members**.
- **Reinforce allies** when attacked by enemy.
- **Sneaky defense:** reinforce weaker players likely to be targeted to gain **defensive kills** and **drain enemy troops**.
- Always **use counter-recon** (Enemies can not scout you)

---

## 💥 **Scattered Points Awareness**

> ⚠️ Scattered points win or lose battles

- When a building is lost, **tons of points scatter** across the map.
- Watch for **yellow dots on the mini-map** - they mark scattered points!
- **teleport and collect** them -> These Points sometimes can WIN the game!

---

## 🎭 **Bait-and-Clear Strategy**

> 🧠 **Use your enemy's greed against them!**

- 🎯 **Intentionally leave some buildings for the enemy** to occupy.

  - Let them **collect points**, then **clear them out**.
  - When the building flips, it **scatters massive points** - **collect them fast!**

- ⚠️ The same applies to **you** -
  If no one is attacking your building, they may be **waiting until it's full of points** before swooping in to clear it!
