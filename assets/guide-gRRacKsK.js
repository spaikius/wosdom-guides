### ⚔️ **Phase 1 — First Minutes of the Battle**

#### ⚙️ **Preparation**

🐉 **Combat buffs and pets** work — use them for an edge!

- Especially the **Troop Deployment Capacity buff** — the fewer people we need to fill a rally, the more can focus on other objectives!

#### ⚔️ **Rally Joining Guide**

##### 🛡️ **Defensive Rallies**

- Use **Patrick** as your main hero — his defense skills are key when holding!
- Recommended formations:
  - **60 / 40 / 0** → Infantry / Lancer / Marksman (balanced defense)
  - **80 / 20 / 0** → when facing strong rally pushes — prioritize survivability

##### 💥 **Offensive Rallies**

- Use **Jessie** as your **main hero** — her **R5 skill** gives a **+25% attack boost**, which is essential!
- Recommended formation:
  - **30 / 20 / 50** → Infantry / Lancer / Marksman

---

#### 🧭 **Early Battle Plan**

1️⃣ **HxH and RoK:**

- Immediately **create all available rallies** as soon as the battle begins.

2️⃣ **Zantas:**

- Will attempt to **solo capture the Sunfire Castle** right at the start.

3️⃣ **MiS Members (supporting Zantas):**

- Send **solo attacks** using a **Defensive Formation (60/40/0)** with a **defensive hero as lead** to help hold the castle.

## 🍎 **SVS — Trigger Call & Rally Coordination Protocol** 🍏

---

### 🚨 **Trigger Signal**

Once the **enemy's strongest rally** is **created**,  
Command will issue the **Trigger Call** in rally-lead chat:

> apple 🍎🍏🍎🍏

This is the signal for **RoK** and **HxH** to **initiate their counter rallies**.  
**Rally Order:** HxH ➡️ RoK ➡️ Zantas

---

### ⚔️ **Rally Timing & Coordination**

- ⏱️ **Timing is critical** — the gap between rallies should be **no more than 10 seconds**.
- 💬 **Do not delay or overthink** — once the call is made, **move fast and clean**.
- 🧭 Both alliances (**RoK + HxH**) must **coordinate rally order** —  
  → The **strongest rallies** should **launch last** for **maximum impact**.
- 🗣️ After **RoK** and **HxH rally leads** create their rallies,  
  they must **immediately notify the team** in chat.

---

### 🏰 **Castle Control Outcomes**

**If Zantas successfully defends Sunfire Castle:**
➡️ **HxH** and **RoK** must **cancel their rallies immediately** — conserve troops and maintain Zantas' hold.

**If Zantas is kicked out of the Castle:**
➡️ Once **RoK** and **HxH** **recapture** the castle,  
**Zantas** will send his troops to **take control back** from them.

> 🏆 This ensures **Zantas remains the final holder** of Sunfire Castle,  
> while **HxH** and **RoK** act as **main counter-rally and support teams** during the recovery phase.

---

## 🏰 **Phase 3 — Taking Back the Castle**

When the **enemy captures the Sunfire Castle**, we switch into **"Reclaim Mode."**

---

### ⚔️ **Rally Order & Coordination**

**🎯 Rally Chain:**  
➡️ **HxH → RoK → Zantas**

1️⃣ Once ready, **HxH** will **create their rallies first.**  
2️⃣ After **HxH** rallies are launched, **RoK** will **create theirs** in quick succession.  
3️⃣ Once **RoK's strongest rally leads** give the **command**,  
➡️ **Zantas** will **create his rally last**, ensuring his **strike lands last** — after both **HxH** and **RoK** have already hit the castle.

> ⏱️ Keep rally intervals **under 10 seconds** for tight synchronization and maximum impact.

## 📜 **Tips & Important Notices**

⚠️ **Troop Mechanics Reminder:**  
In Sunfire Castle battles, **lightly injured troops remain inside** the castle but **no longer contribute to defense.**  
This means your **active defensive strength drops over time** as more troops become lightly injured.

💥 **All MiS members** inside the castle must **constantly send fresh reinforcements** to replace lightly injured troops and maintain maximum defense power.
