## 🦾 **Rally Leader Playbook**

### ⚙️ What REALLY matters

- 🧠 Your **3 selected heroes all apply their Expedition Skills**  
  → Choose **top-tier combat heroes** with Attack / Lethality bonuses
- 🪓 Use **full mythic gear** or your strongest available set

  - Lethality is extremely important

- 📈 Buffs that help:

  - VIP
  - Skins
  - Research
  - Temporary boosts

### ✔️ Do's for Rally Leaders

- **Do** use strong **Infantry / Lancer / Marksman DPS heroes**
- **Do** max their Expedition Skills whenever possible
- **Do** run as many rallies as possible within 30 minutes (5 rallies)

### ❌ Don'ts for Rally Leaders

- **Don't** use heroes with **non-combat** or **economic** skills
- **Don't** use low-level, Blue, or low skill level heroes

## 🤝 **Rally Joiner Playbook**

### 🎯 What matters most

- ⭐ **Only your FIRST hero matters**
  → And only their **FIRST Expedition Skill**
- 💥 That skill must be:

  - Attack buff
  - Lethality buff
  - Damage bonus

- 🔥 Skill level should be **5**
- 🪖 Bring your **best troops**, but remember:  
  → **Hero > troops** for buffs

### ❌ Common Joiner Mistakes

- Bringing heroes with **no combat skills** (e.g., gathering skills)
- Placing the wrong hero in the **first slot**

## 🧩 **Myths & Misconceptions**

### ❌ **Myth:** Strong players joining my rally = higher damage

**✔️ Truth:** Only **heroes/skills** matter for buffs — not troop power.

### ❌ Myth: Joiner gear doesn't matter

**✔️ Truth:**

- Gear doesn't boost the _rally buff_,
- BUT it **does** increase _your personal damage_ (more rewards).
