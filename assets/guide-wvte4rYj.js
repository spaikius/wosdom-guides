## 🧠 **Cheat Sheet - Smart Canyon Play**

- 🎯 **Focus the center first** - both the **Citadel** and **Fortresses** yield **1,800 pts/min**

  > Securing even one from the enemy can **guarantee victory before endgame**

- 🚧 **Avoid overextending** - defend your side buildings and don't push too deep
- 🛡️ **Hold adjacent support buildings** - they protect the middle and flank routes
- 🔙 If a building queue is full (**5 squads waiting**), **retreat** to another target to stay active
- 🌀 **Don't clog the hub!** If **10 players** are already in one building, **move elsewhere** - flank, intercept reinforcements, or harass enemy supply lines

---

### ⚙️ **Preparation Phase**

✅ **Everyone sign up** with your **3 strongest hero squads**

- 🧩 **Squad 1:** All 3 heroes **attack-focused**
- 🛡️ **Squad 2:** All 3 heroes **defense-focused**
- ⚔️ **Squad 3:** Best leftover heroes - fill all slots

🐉 **Combat buffs and pets** work - always use them for an edge  
⚡ **March speed-ups** are allowed and **extremely useful**  
🔙 If a building has **5 squads waiting in queue**, **retreat** your squad to an adjacent **friendly or enemy building**  
❤️ If your march is in an **uncontested building**, click it → **Conscript** to instantly heal your troops

> 🔸 Much faster than letting them die and respawn

### ⚔️ **Phase 1 - Early Game (First ~17 min)**

🗺️ Quickly **occupy all neutral buildings** in your territory  
🛡️ **Defend bridges and chokepoints** - these are your main entry points  
🎯 **Steal enemy buildings** early if you can safely push across  
⚠️ **Don't overextend!**

> 🩸 **Teamwork wins Canyon Clash - not solo heroics.**
> Hold your ground and support allies 💪

### 🏯 **Phase 2 - Fortress War (~Next 20 min)**

🔥 **Fortresses unlock** - these generate **massive points per minute**  
🏰 **Hold your alliance fortress at all costs**  
🚩 **Capture one enemy fortress** if possible - holding **two** nearly guarantees victory  
👥 Keep **players stationed at adjacent buildings** to **instantly occupy** a fortress the moment it opens
🧱 **Fortresses are control hubs** - whoever owns them usually controls **the entire map flow**

### 👑 **Phase 3 - Citadel Onslaught (Final ~20 min)**

🏆 The **Citadel (center)** opens - containing **10-11 guards**  
🥇 The **march that defeats the final guard** gets **first control**  
💥 Once captured, it's **very hard to take back** - so timing is everything

---

#### ❌ **If We Don't Control the Center**

🚫 Stop sending random marches to the middle  
✂️ **Cut off** the enemy's access - each territory has **one key building** blocking their route  
⚔️ Once they're cut off, **push the center** and capture it  
🏰 Or **take their fortress** - both give the **same points per minute**

> 🧭 **Either the Citadel or a Fortress** can swing the battle - control one and defend it.

---

#### ✅ **If We Do Control the Center**

🔒 Don't allow your connection to be cut off  
♻️ **Rotate marches** - ensure the Citadel is never empty  
🏠 Continue **defending your other holdings** - losing territory still loses points
